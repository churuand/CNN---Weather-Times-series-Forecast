# Convolutional neural network: Weather Forecasting 
## About this Project:
This project addresses energy consumption optimization in Delhi, India, where accurate temperature forecasting is crucial. We aim to predict mean daily temperatures with a two-week horizon using historical data from 2013 to 2017. Two models, Model 1 and Model 2, both employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), were created and evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
